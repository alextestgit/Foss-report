</header>

  <p>This report summarizes the FOSS related issues identified in the FOSS scan performed on WSF 9.22.0 in 22/12/03 at 10:38:59</p>
  <p>The report includes 6 sections:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>FOSS with security vulnerability - this section lists any FOSS used that was identified as having a High or Critical security vulnerability and its version needs to be replaced to a clean version</li>
    <li>Unapproved FOSS - this section lists all the FOSS that are unapproved. A FOSS may be unapproved due to its license being unreviewed (new license that was not looked at yet by Legal) or being in the blacklist. In case of unreviewed license, an online form should be submitted in order to approve the new license. In case of blacklisted license, the FOSS should either be removed or an online form submitted in order to exceptionally approve the use of the FOSS (notice that there will have to be a good case for getting an exception approval for a blacklisted license. Such a case may be when thereâ€™s a strong de-coupling between the FOSS and amdocs SW, e.g. no link).</li>
    <li>FOSS with missing source code - this section lists any FOSS used that its sources could not be located</li>
    <li> FOSS with missing license - this section lists any FOSS that the scanner was not able to identify its license</li>
    <li>FOSS with limitations - this section lists any FOSS used that has use limitations defined by Legal and requires validation for compliance with the limitations</li>
    <li>Commercial SW - this section lists any 3rd party SW that was identified in the scan with a commercial license (i.e. it's not a FOSS) and needs to be verified for inclusion in the amdocs package</li>
  </ol>
